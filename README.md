<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

This project was created for the Upperline Code - Round 1 Interview (Summer 2022). 

Build out a command-line adventure game. Feel free to draw inspiration from stories and gameplay from sources like Oregon Trail, Goosebumps: Choose Your Own Adventure, Pokemon, D&amp;D, your favorite movie, book, or game, or craft a story from your own imagination.

Use the `README.md` to get started.

<!-- Coding Process -->

## Coding Process

I decided to select the extra difficult assignment because:
- I have never created a command-line adventure game
- I have never used Python to complete a small project 
- I wanted to do something new, fun, and somethig my daughter would enjoy playing

I found a slideshow version of this story and converted it into a command-line adventure game. This project is my first attempt to get the code to work the way I thought the user should experience. There is always room for improvement.
